# pythonCsgoBombTimer
Small python scripts to check the bomb timer. Somewhat complete, all feedback welcome.
Currently only tested on a Windows machine. I presume this will not work on MacOS as it should.

## How to use

Copy the gamestate_integration_bombtimer.cfg to your Counter-Strike:Global Offensive config folder, located at an address like this:
- **C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg**<br>
This will allow Counter-Strike to send you gamestate updates.

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed (developped on Python 3.7.1).
Navigate to the directory of the program and run the main.py program with Python in the cmd.
- C:\Users\User...> **py main.py**
